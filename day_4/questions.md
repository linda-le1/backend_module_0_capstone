## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
A method is an action, procedure, or process that you can use repeatedly throughout your code.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

hello

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello (Dave)

This would return "Dave I am".

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

I feel that I'm familiar with the basics but would need more practice to build more complex methods.

## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
Conditional statements, or if statements, tell the code that if something is true, then do x and if not, then do y. Three examples are "if", "elsif", and "else".
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
To assign different actions accordingly. 

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
Just the word "if" followed by the condition.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You use "elsif" as many times as needed and then end the whole thing with "else" and then "end".

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
An example of this would be:
if number < 5
  puts "Close!"
elsif number == 1
  puts "Great job!"
else

end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
